#### Step 1 Overview
- A lot of our job kinda depends on whatever the design team decides on, so we can work in collaboration with them later today in the meeting
- I (Alan) am planning on sketching a bunch of things to bring to the meeting, so we can map out things from there
- I can't imagine the step 1 stuff being super hard, ChatGPT is gonna be our best friend though considering I've barely ever done CSS lol
