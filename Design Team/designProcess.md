# Design Process
## Step 1: 
1. Wireframe individual cards and the card deck layout.

We came up with the idea of the card design by first thinking of the color theme/pallete from our original mascot color pallete, which contains a light blue and pink color. We believed that the front of the card should remain a neutral, beige color and have a minimalist look with the letter or number followed by one of the 4 symbols to have the pink or blue color scheme. For the back of the card, we decided to make it completely blue and have our mascot, Eleveny, make an appearance as a design to resemble the way regular playing cards have a character right side up and one upside down, which we thought we could do with our own mascot of choice.
