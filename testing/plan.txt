*** Rough Plan ***

Visual testing:
- Color scheme
- Shuffling animation
- Card covers
- Flip animations

Unit Testing:
- Write a test JS script

Functional Testing:
 - Do the buttons on the screen work as intended on click?
   - Hit button
   - Play button
   - Stand button
   - Can you click things you shouldn't be able to?



***Documentation***:

1. Visual Testing
  - Color scheme appears to be consistent ✅
  - Shuffling animation ...
  - Is the card cover consistent (displays the team mascot)? ✅
  - Flip animation:
    - Seems consistent ✅
    - No delay/lag ✅

2. Unit testing

3. Functional testing:
  - Possible problems with "play button" (see below)
  - Waiting on other logic to be finished


Possible errors/confusion:
  - Visual:
    - Shuffling animation seems to be a bit off? (Unless it was intentional, then it's fine)
  
  - Unit testing:

  - Functional:
    - On press "Play":
      - When dealing cards to the ai, once a card is dealt and flipped, the animation does not terminate,
        ultimately showing two cards when there's only only supposed to be one
      - Animations that are already in motion do not cancel out, possibly carrying out parallel function calls

    - On press "Hit" (logic not complete)
      - Even at the start of the game, the user is allowed to press "hit" and would be dealt a single card (should not be the case)
    
    - Player is still allowed to press "hit" even though cards on table cross the sum of 21
      - Logic not done
  


***Possible additions***

  - Hide the hit/stand button until "Play" is pressed
