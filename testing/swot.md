# SWOT Analysis (Blackjack Game)

## Strengths
- **Clear Structure**: The code is organized especially with the classes being clear and easy to understand / read.
- **Visuals**: The project uses custom images as well as CSS animations to make it look more appealing to the user.
- **Interactive UI**: The UI for playing, hitting, etc works as intended and have their own dedicated functions
- **Custom Assets**: The project includes custom card and suit images. This allows it to look like a deck / playing card when in the game. 
- **Responsive**: The app is able to function on any screen.
- **Animation**: The project includes card flip and shuffle animations which makes the game more visually appealing.

## Weaknesses
- **Incomplete Game Logic**: Some core Blackjack features is missing or incomplete
- **Accessibility**: The game relies heavily on visuals and may not be accessible to users with disabilities 
- **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for edge-specific cases (e.g., what happens if the deck runs out of cards mid-game).
- **Scalability**: The code is made for one mode and would require code-breaking changes to support multiplayer or any additional features.

## Opportunities
- **More Features**: Add more advanced Blackjack rules (splitting, doubling down, insurance), player profiles (such as a winning streak), or multiplayer support.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Improve responsiveness and touch controls for mobile devices.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Add ARIA related features for the disabled
- **Different AI Modes**: Implement the different AI modes for the dealer so it is more fun and the player can stay engaged.
  
## Threats
- **Browser Compatibility**: The game may not work in older browsers due to it's reliance on the current javascript code
- **Asset Management**: There can be a performance or reference issue since the assets are hardcoded
- **Competition**: The project will not be able to stand out as it currently is and other teams can stand out.

## HTML Team Analysis:
### Strengths
We worked together efficiently using pair programming techniques. We were able to work much faster and utilize each other's skills to resolve issues.
### Weaknesses
By working together using pair programming, there were some instances where one of us had to wait for the other member to complete a task so we could continue. This was a little inefficient.
### Opportunities
We could have explored other techniques of working together and ways to make our programming more efficient.
### Threats
Our pair programming approach may become more difficult to use when we are working on more files and more complicated structures.

## CSS Team Analysis:
### Strengths
Mia and I (Alan) worked very well together and teammwork was very well done. We were able to communicate and work through different issues by meeting together outside of class to finish our part of the warmup.
### Weaknesses
We both don't have a lot of experience in CSS, therefore putting us at a huge disavantage, especially considering that lab 3 was not done prior to this warmup.
### Opportunities
Through both the labs, lectures, and online resources, we can understand CSS on a more profound level and therefore understand how to perform better in our project. 
### Threats
There was a lot of misunderstanding from both ourselves and other groups about what CSS is able to do and what it can't. There should be more defined lines on what each team should do in the future.

## Testing Team Analysis:
### Strengths
Singe I (Aryan) was the only one on the team, getting things done and finalizing them was a quick, easy, and efficient process
### Weakness
Working alone was also a weakness because the tests I made were the ones that would be used without any review.
### Opportunities
I can learn a lot about the testing field, all the while learning about JavaScript on the side in case the logic development team needs another hand.
### Threats
Since I'm the only one in testing as of right now, I can not afford to miss anything (Because then there is no one to take over).

## Design Team Analysis:
### Strengths:
The Design Team consisted of Verania and Khang, and we believed that our design had the strengths with the aesthetic look that we had on Figma. We had a good idea of how our cards were going to look with the color pallete that matched out team's mascot, as well with the minimalistic look of a simple layout that we wanted to have from the beginning.
### Weakness:
The Design Team's Weakness was definitely having more features that we wanted to implement to make the game more like the Black Jack games online, but we had a short amount of time to just design the simple functionalities of a simple Black Jack Game.
### Opportunities
If we had more time to work on the warmup, we would have refined/touch up some of the visuals for some of the features we had. For next time, when we have time before we send our design to the html and css team, we could conduct surveys to get user feedback on our initial design.
### Threats
Having to start early. Without a design/blueprint for our app, other teams can't really start on the code. This means we would need to meet up earlier and brainstorm beforehand so that other teams have enough time to implement our design.

## JS Team Analysis:
### Strengths:
When assigning tasks and determining which features took priority over others, we evenly distributed the work load. In addition to such, individually, we were able to test one another's code before implementing other features to ensure compatibility.
### Weakness:
As a team, we were overdependent on the other teams. (Specifically HTML and CSS) We tried to revolve our code with the current implementations rather than what could be worked on, resulting in multiple minor setbacks that pilled up over time. In addition, some code written could've been cleaned to reduce complexity and redundancy. On the flip side, some functions could've been expanded for the potential of scalability further down the line.
### Opportunities
If our team was given more time, the team could've taken more time to write cleaner code and implement features that were missing from the final product. The betting system in particular was a feature that was not implemented due to a lack of time.
### Threats
Continue to remain overreliant on other teams and stay passive in the design of the app logistics would result in time wasted. The team needs to take initiative and improve communication with other teams on the web app design visually and logically.
