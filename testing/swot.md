# SWOT Analysis (Blackjack Game)

## Strengths
- **Clear Structure**: The code is organized especially with the classes being clear and easy to understand / read.
- **Visuals**: The project uses custom images as well as CSS animations to make it look more appealing to the user.
- **Interactive UI**: The UI for playing, hitting, etc works as intended and have their own dedicated functions
- **Custom Assets**: The project includes custom card and suit images. This allows it to look like a deck / playing card when in the game. 
- **Responsive**: The app is able to function on any screen.
- **Animation**: The project includes card flip and shuffle animations which makes the game more visually appealing.

## Weaknesses
- **Incomplete Game Logic**: Some core Blackjack features is missing or incomplete
- **Accessibility**: The game relies heavily on visuals and may not be accessible to users with disabilities 
- **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for edge-specific cases (e.g., what happens if the deck runs out of cards mid-game).
- **Scalability**: The code is made for one mode and would require code-breaking changes to support multiplayer or any additional features.

## Opportunities
- **More Features**: Add more advanced Blackjack rules (splitting, doubling down, insurance), player profiles (such as a winning streak), or multiplayer support.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Improve responsiveness and touch controls for mobile devices.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Add ARIA related features for the disabled
- **Different AI Modes**: Implement the different AI modes for the dealer so it is more fun and the player can stay engaged.
  
## Threats
- **Browser Compatibility**: The game may not work in older browsers due to it's reliance on the current javascript code
- **Asset Management**: There can be a performance or reference issue since the assets are hardcoded
- **Competition**: The project will not be able to stand out as it currently is and other teams can stand out.

## HTML Team Analysis:
### Strengths
We worked together efficiently using pair programming techniques. We were able to work much faster and utilize each other's skills to resolve issues.
### Weaknesses
By working together using pair programming, there were some instances where one of us had to wait for the other member to complete a task so we could continue. This was a little inefficient.
### Opportunities
We could have explored other techniques of working together and ways to make our programming more efficient.
### Threats
Our pair programming approach may become more difficult to use when we are working on more files and more complicated structures.

## Testing Team Analysis:
### Strengths
Singe I (Aryan) was the only one on the team, getting things done and finalizing them was a quick, easy, and efficient process
### Weakness
Working alone was also a weakness because the tests I made were the ones that would be used without any review.
### Opportunities
I can learn a lot about the testing field, all the while learning about JavaScript on the side in case the logic development team needs another hand.
### Threats
Since I'm the only one in testing as of right now, I can not afford to miss anything (Because then there is no one to take over).

## Design Team Analysis:
### Strengths:
The Design Team consisted of Verania and Khang, and we believed that our design had the strengths with the aesthetic look that we had on Figma. We had a good idea of how our cards were going to look with the color pallete that matched out team's mascot, as well with the minimalistic look of a simple layout that we wanted to have from the beginning.
### Weakness:
The Design Team's Weakness was definitely having more features that we wanted to implement to make the game more like the Black Jack games online, but we had a short amount of time to just design the simple functionalities of a simple Black Jack Game.
